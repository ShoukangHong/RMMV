# SRPG AoE Group Animation
Requires SRPG_AoE.js and Yanfly Battle Engine

This script changes the how AoE animations are shown in non-map battle scenarios. Normally an AoE skill with multiple targets will involve multiple 1 vs 1 battles played out.
This script combines all targets onto 1 battle scene for a 1 vs many scenario.
